# letterboxd_time_calc
A small python script that will calculate the total time you spend watching movies

This is the first python program i wrote, so it may be broken and bugged 

For it to run you will need : requests, BeautifulSoup and lxml so do this 


`pip install requests
pip install requests
pip install requests
`
