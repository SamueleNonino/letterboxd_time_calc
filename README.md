# letterboxd time calculator 
## i love leterboxd but it dosent have a total time calculator (like tvtime) so i made it 
A small python script that will calculate the total time you spend watching movies

This is the first python program i wrote, so it may be broken and bugged 

in order to run it you will need : requests, BeautifulSoup and lxml so do this 

```
pip install requests
pip install BeautifulSoup
pip install lxml
```

then cd in the dir where is saved and run it
